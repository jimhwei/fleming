    <h3>YouTube Transcription With Google Cloud and JavaScript</h3>
    <p>YouTube is a great place for entertainment and more importantly, a place
    to watch how to jump start your car when your batteries are dead (True story).
    After learning JavaScript in my post-grad porgram, I decided I want to go
    further with what I have learned and build things. The problem is, there
    are so many YouTube videos out there and not enough time to watch everything.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite channels on Youtube is TechLead. TechLead's channel
    is all things programming related and geeky things. His deadpan humor and
    robotic charm never cease to makes me laugh. Naturally, when I saw that he
    had a tutorial about how to transcribe YouTube videos into a text document.
    I knew I had to work on this project by myself so I can read the text
    before deciding if it is a quality video.</p>
